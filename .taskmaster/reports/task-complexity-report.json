      "taskTitle": "Setup Firebase Project and Next.js Application",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Firebase and Next.js setup into distinct configuration phases: Firebase project creation and service setup, Next.js application initialization, dependency installation and configuration, environment setup, and project structure organization.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple technology integrations and configuration steps. While individual steps are straightforward, proper setup requires understanding of both Firebase and Next.js ecosystems."

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide authentication implementation into core components: authentication context and state management, login/registration UI components, OAuth integration, route protection middleware, session management, and error handling with user feedback.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to security considerations, multiple authentication methods, state management across the app, and integration with Firebase Auth. Requires careful handling of user sessions and security."

      "taskTitle": "Setup Firestore Data Models and Security Rules",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure data modeling into logical phases: Firestore collection schema design and TypeScript interfaces, security rules implementation for each collection, access control and permission logic, and testing with Firebase Emulator Suite.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to database design decisions that affect the entire application, security rule complexity, and the need for thorough testing to prevent data breaches."

      "taskTitle": "Build Board Management System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize board management into functional areas: board listing and display UI, board creation and validation forms, board editing and update functionality, board deletion with proper confirmations, and Firestore integration with error handling.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving CRUD operations, UI state management, data validation, and user permission handling. Foundation for other features makes it critical to implement correctly."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down task management into hierarchical components: task creation and form handling, task listing and display within boards, sub-task creation and nesting logic, status management and updates, date handling and validation, and hierarchical data operations.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to hierarchical data relationships, multiple UI states, date handling, and complex data operations. Core functionality that affects user workflow significantly."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Sub-task Assignment System",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize assignment functionality into logical components: assignment UI and member selection, assignment data model and Firestore updates, assignment tracking and history, and assignment-based access control and security.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity building on existing systems. Primarily involves extending current functionality with assignment logic and updating security rules."

      "taskTitle": "Create Personal Task Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure the dashboard into data and presentation layers: cross-board task aggregation and Firestore queries, dashboard UI and task display components, filtering and sorting functionality, and real-time updates and state management.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving complex Firestore queries, data aggregation across multiple collections, and real-time updates. Requires efficient data fetching and state management."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Data Synchronization",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down real-time functionality into technical components: Firestore listener implementation and management, real-time context and state synchronization, optimistic updates and conflict resolution, offline handling and connection management, and performance optimization and memory management.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to real-time synchronization challenges, memory management, conflict resolution, and offline scenarios. Requires deep understanding of Firestore listeners and React state management."
