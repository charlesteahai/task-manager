# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Task Creation and Listing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a task creation form and implement the task list view within the board detail page

## 3. Implement Sub-task Creation and Hierarchical View [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build sub-task creation functionality within tasks and create a hierarchical view showing tasks and their sub-tasks
### Details:
Create a sub-task creation interface within the task detail view. Implement API endpoints for sub-task CRUD operations. Develop a hierarchical view component that displays tasks and their associated sub-tasks with proper indentation and visual cues. Add collapsible/expandable functionality for sub-task sections.

## 4. Implement Task and Sub-task Editing [done]
