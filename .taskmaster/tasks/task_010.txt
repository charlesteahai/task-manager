# Task ID: 10
# Title: Polish UI/UX and Add Final Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement responsive design, loading states, error handling, and overall user experience improvements
# Details:
1. Ensure full responsive design across all components
2. Add comprehensive loading skeletons using Shadcn
3. Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
4. Add toast notifications for user actions
5. Optimize performance with React.memo and useMemo
6. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
7. Implement proper focus management for accessibility
8. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
9. Create 404 and error pages
10. Add final polish to animations and transitions

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive design on various screen sizes, verify loading states and error handling, test accessibility with screen readers, validate performance optimizations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Responsive Design and Loading States [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all components adapt to different screen sizes and implement loading skeletons using Shadcn UI
### Details:
Use CSS media queries and flexbox/grid layouts to make all components responsive. Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. Implement Shadcn UI skeleton components for all data-fetching operations. Add loading states to buttons and forms during submission.

## 2. Add Error Handling and Notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement error boundaries, toast notifications, and create error/404 pages
### Details:
Create React error boundary components to catch and display UI errors. Implement toast notifications using a library like react-hot-toast for user actions (success, error, info). Design and implement custom 404 and error pages that match the application style.

## 3. Implement Accessibility Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add keyboard shortcuts and proper focus management for better accessibility
### Details:
Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions using a library like react-hotkeys. Ensure proper focus management by using refs and focus() for modals, dialogs, and form submissions. Add appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements. Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus states.

## 4. Add Confirmation Dialogs and Polish Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive actions and refine animations/transitions
### Details:
Create reusable confirmation dialog component for actions like delete or cancel. Implement using a modal or dialog component from Shadcn. Polish existing animations and add subtle transitions between states using CSS transitions or a library like Framer Motion. Ensure animations are not too slow or distracting.

## 5. Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Improve application performance using React optimization techniques
### Details:
Identify and apply React.memo to components that re-render frequently but with the same props. Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations and callback functions. Analyze and fix any render bottlenecks using React DevTools Profiler. Ensure list components use proper key props for optimal rendering.
