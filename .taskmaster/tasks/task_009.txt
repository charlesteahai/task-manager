# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Real-time Data Synchronization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time updates using Firestore listeners to sync changes across all users and sessions
# Details:
1. Implement Firestore onSnapshot listeners for boards, tasks, and sub-tasks
2. Create real-time context for managing live data
3. Add optimistic updates for better UX
4. Implement conflict resolution for concurrent edits
5. Add connection status indicators
6. Handle offline scenarios gracefully
7. Optimize listener management to prevent memory leaks
8. Add real-time notifications for board changes
9. Implement proper cleanup on component unmount

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time updates with multiple users, verify optimistic updates, test offline/online scenarios, validate memory management and listener cleanup

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Real-time Data Context Provider [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a React context provider that will manage real-time data connections and state for the application
### Details:
Create a new context file (RealtimeContext.js) with a provider component that will: 1) Initialize connection state tracking, 2) Set up methods for subscribing to Firestore collections, 3) Implement connection status management, 4) Create a central store for all active listeners, 5) Provide helper methods for components to access real-time data

## 2. Implement Board and Task Listeners [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up Firestore onSnapshot listeners for boards and tasks collections to receive real-time updates
### Details:
Create listener functions that: 1) Subscribe to the boards collection and specific task collections, 2) Process incoming snapshots to update application state, 3) Transform Firestore documents into application data models, 4) Implement proper error handling for failed listeners, 5) Add logging for debugging purposes

## 3. Add Optimistic Updates and Conflict Resolution [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience and handle potential conflicts from concurrent edits
### Details:
1) Modify data mutation functions to update local state immediately before sending to Firestore, 2) Implement versioning or timestamp-based conflict detection, 3) Create conflict resolution UI components that appear when conflicts are detected, 4) Add merge strategies for different data types (boards vs tasks), 5) Implement rollback mechanism for failed updates

## 4. Implement Connection Status and Offline Mode [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Add UI indicators for connection status and implement graceful handling of offline scenarios
### Details:
1) Create a connection status indicator component that shows online/offline state, 2) Implement Firestore offline persistence configuration, 3) Add logic to queue updates when offline and sync when connection is restored, 4) Create user notifications for connection changes, 5) Implement read-only mode for certain features when offline

## 5. Add Real-time Notifications and Listener Cleanup [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Implement user notifications for real-time changes and ensure proper cleanup of listeners to prevent memory leaks
### Details:
1) Create a notification system for alerting users about changes made by others, 2) Implement proper unsubscribe logic for all listeners when components unmount, 3) Add listener management to track and clean up all active subscriptions, 4) Optimize listener creation to prevent duplicate subscriptions, 5) Implement batch updates for efficiency when multiple changes occur
